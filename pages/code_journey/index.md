# My journey to learn JavaScript

In 1981 I received my first computer, a Texas Instruments 99/4A, as a gift from my dad's cousin who was living with us at the time.  It was a Christmas present and it instantly changed my life forever.

I would rush home from school to spend time playing the games as first, but then I found the inline basic and I literally spent hours playing around and learning how to write simple programs.

```
10 print "Hello Craig"
20 goto 10
```

Not actually the first program I ever write but it was 38 years ago and I can't remember exactly what my first program was but it was something very "basic" like that. The point is, I spent every extra minute experimenting with writing Basic.

The computer had no disk drive, not even a tape drive (yes computers used to store data on cassette tapes) and no printer, so I would write out my programs in a notebook.  When I turned the computer off and back on, I would have to retype the entire program to have it run again.
